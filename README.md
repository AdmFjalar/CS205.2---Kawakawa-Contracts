# CS205.2 - Kawakawa-Contracts
## Purpose
This project was created for CS205.2 at Yoobee College of Creative Innovation. 
The purpose of the software is offering a free way of comparing contracts and/or documents for consumers who cannot afford enterprise level software, using SHA3-512 to quickly process large amounts of text, and an LCS approach for highlighting changes.
